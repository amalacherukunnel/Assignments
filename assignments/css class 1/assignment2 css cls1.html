        <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. 
        CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page.
         It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want.
        CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.

            While HTML uses tags, CSS uses rulesets. CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.</p>
